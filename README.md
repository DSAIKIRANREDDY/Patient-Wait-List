# 📊 Power BI Project: Patient Waitlist Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **Patient Waitlists** across different medical specialities, case types, and time bands. The dashboards provide interactive insights into patient wait times, distributions, and trends over time, enabling healthcare organizations to optimize resource allocation and improve patient care.  

The dataset is visualized in **Power BI** to generate meaningful reports and dashboards with filtering and drill-down capabilities.
